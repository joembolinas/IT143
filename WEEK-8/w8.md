# üß† My Reflection: Week 8 CTF Challenge ‚Äì *Web Traffic Inspector*

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Challenge Summary:

This week's CTF challenge threw me into the role of a digital forensics investigator monitoring intercepted web traffic on the "Digital Highway." The scenario was intense: sensitive data was leaking in plain text, API responses were exposing session tokens and authentication keys without encryption, and enemy operatives were potentially using these leaks to move undetected between Cyboria's domains. My mission was clear but complex‚Äîanalyze a massive HAR file containing intercepted web traffic, extract sensitive authentication tokens from API responses, and identify a leaked session token containing a hidden flag.

The challenge specifically hinted that the flag would be buried in a JSON response field formatted as:

```json
{ "status": "success", "session_token": "FLAG{h4r_f1le_4n4lys1s_w1n}" }
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Built: Enhanced Python HAR Analyzer with GUI

### **Initial Tool Development**

When I first approached this challenge, I realized I needed a robust tool for HAR file analysis. I started by building a **comprehensive HAR File Analyzer using Python** with multiple components:

* **Core Libraries**: `tkinter` for GUI, `json` for HAR parsing, `re` for pattern matching
* **Enhanced GUI**: Tabbed interface with dedicated sections for different analysis types
* **Flag Detection Engine**: Custom regex patterns to find hidden flags
* **Session Token Extractor**: Specialized parser for authentication tokens

### **Tool Evolution Process**

My development went through several iterations:

1. **Basic HAR Parser** - Started with simple JSON parsing
2. **GUI Enhancement** - Added user-friendly interface with tables
3. **CTF-Specific Features** - Integrated flag detection and token extraction
4. **Error Handling** - Made the tool robust for real-world HAR files

## üîç My Thought Process & Strategic Approach

### **1. Understanding the Challenge Scope**

My first step was to analyze what I was up against:

* **File Size**: The HAR file contained **15,000 network requests** - massive scale
* **Target Pattern**: Looking for `FLAG{...}` specifically in session tokens
* **Needle in Haystack**: One flag hidden among thousands of legitimate requests
* **Technical Challenge**: Parse JSON responses within a complex HAR structure

I realized this wasn't just about coding‚Äîit required a systematic investigation approach.

### **2. Initial Technical Hurdles**

Right off the bat, I encountered several technical challenges:

#### **Dependency Issues**

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'haralyzer'
```

**My Decision**: Instead of fighting with external dependencies, I chose to build a pure Python solution using only standard libraries. This made my tool more portable and reliable.

#### **HAR File Structure Problems**

```
Invalid HAR file structure. Missing key: 'time'
```

**My Approach**: I implemented defensive programming with `.get()` methods and try-catch blocks to handle inconsistent HAR file formats gracefully.

### **3. Strategic Analysis Methodology**

I developed a multi-pronged approach:

#### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**

* Load and validate the HAR file structure
* Count total entries (discovered 15,000 requests)
* Identify data patterns and common response formats

#### **Phase 2: Targeted Search**

* Focus on API endpoints (URLs containing `/api/`)
* Parse JSON responses for session tokens
* Use regex pattern matching for `FLAG{...}` structures

#### **Phase 3: Deep Analysis**

* Extract all session tokens for comparison
* Analyze response patterns and data structures
* Cross-reference suspicious entries

## üéØ The Investigation Process

### **Step 1: Building the Core Parser**

I started with a robust HAR file parser:

```python
def load_har_file(self):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        har_data = json.load(file)
    entries = har_data['log']['entries']
```

**Challenge Encountered**: Some entries were missing required fields like 'time'
**Solution**: Implemented safe dictionary access with default values

### **Step 2: Implementing Flag Detection**

The core of my investigation was the flag detection algorithm:

```python
def search_for_flags(self):
    flag_pattern = r'FLAG\{[^}]+\}'
    # Search through all response bodies, headers, and session tokens
```

**Thinking Process**: I realized flags could be hidden in multiple locations:

* Response body text
* JSON session token fields
* HTTP headers
* URL parameters

### **Step 3: Session Token Extraction**

This was the most critical component:

```python
def extract_session_tokens(self):
    session_patterns = [
        r'"session_token":\s*"([^"]+)"',
        r'"sessionToken":\s*"([^"]+)"',
        r'"token":\s*"([^"]+)"'
    ]
```

**Decision Making**: I used multiple regex patterns to catch different naming conventions for session tokens.

## üî• The Breakthrough Moment

### **Discovery Process**

After implementing my analysis tool, I ran it against the massive HAR file:

```
üéØ CTF ANALYSIS RESULTS
================================================
üìä Total entries processed: 15000
üîç Entries with session tokens: 1000
üö© FLAGS FOUND (1):

1. FLAG: FLAG{h4r_f1le_4n4lys1s_w1n}
   üìç Found in: session_token field
   üåê URL: https://example.com/api/userdata
   üìã Entry #: 7777
   üìÑ Response: {"status": "success", "session_token": "FLAG{h4r_f1le_4n4lys1s_w1n}"}
```

**The Eureka Moment**: Entry #7777 contained the exact pattern described in the challenge! The flag was disguised as a legitimate session token in an API response.

## üí≠ Final Reflection

This CTF challenge was a masterclass in digital forensics and traffic analysis. What started as a simple "find the flag" task evolved into building a comprehensive network traffic analysis platform. The most valuable lesson was learning to think like both an attacker and a defender‚Äîunderstanding how sensitive data can leak through seemingly innocent API responses while also developing the tools and methodologies to detect such leaks.

The satisfaction of uncovering that single flag among 15,000 network requests was immense, but more importantly, I now have a deeper appreciation for the complexity of network security and the critical importance of encrypting all sensitive data in transit. This challenge reinforced that in cybersecurity, the devil truly is in the details, and sometimes the most dangerous vulnerabilities hide in plain sight within the noise of everyday network traffic.

**The hunt for digital evidence requires patience, the right tools, and a systematic approach‚Äîskills that will serve me well in future cybersecurity investigations.**
