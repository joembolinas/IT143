# Step-by-step instructions to run Regex_Info_Extractor.ipynb using a virtual environment in VS Code

1. **Open VS Code in the project folder**
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to `File` > `Open Folder...` and select your project folder: `MO-IT143_Ethical_Hacking_Snippets`.

2. **Open a new terminal in VS Code**
   - Go to `Terminal` > `New Terminal`.
   - The terminal should open in your project folder.

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - If your environment is in the `env` folder, activate it:
     - **Windows (cmd):**
       ```cmd
       env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - **Windows (PowerShell):**
       ```powershell
       .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
       ```
     - **Git Bash or WSL:**
       ```bash
       source env/Scripts/activate
       ```

4. **Install required packages**
   - If not already installed, run:
     ```bash
     pip install pyperclip
     ```

5. **Open the Jupyter Notebook in VS Code**
   - In the VS Code Explorer, click on `Regex_Info_Extractor.ipynb` to open it.
   - If prompted, select the Python interpreter from your `env` virtual environment.

6. **Run the notebook cells**
   - Click the `Run` button (▶️) at the top of each code cell, or use `Run All` to execute all cells in order.

7. **Use the GUI**
   - The Tkinter GUI window will appear when you run the cell that starts the application (`root.mainloop()`).
   - Use the GUI as described in the notebook instructions.

# Troubleshooting
- If you get a `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure your virtual environment is activated and all required packages are installed.
- If the GUI does not appear, check for errors in the notebook output.
