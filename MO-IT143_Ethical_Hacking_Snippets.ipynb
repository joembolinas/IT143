    "This notebook provides Python snippets directly aligned with the concepts and CTF challenges outlined in your **MO-IT143 Ethical Hacking** syllabus. Practice these techniques, focusing on understanding *how* they work and how they apply to identifying and analyzing potential security issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways from Syllabus:**\n",
    "*   Python is crucial for automating file parsing (text, JSON, CSV, logs, HAR).\n",
    "*   Understanding web requests (`requests`) is essential for web interaction and vulnerability testing concepts (like SQLi).\n",
    "*   Basic cryptography (hashing, encoding like Base64) is common in CTFs.\n",
    "*   Debugging and analyzing existing code is a valuable skill (Milestone 2).\n",
